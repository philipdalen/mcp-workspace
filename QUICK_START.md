## ❓ Common Issues

### Server directories are empty

Re-clone the repository - all code is included (no submodules):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philipdalen/mcp.git
```

### Installation failed for a specific server

Install them individually:

```bash
make install-teamwork
make install-telegram
```

### Missing prerequisites

The Makefile will warn you if Node.js or Python is missing. Install the missing tool and run the installation again.

## 🆘 Getting Help

1. Check `SETUP.md` for detailed troubleshooting
2. Review the documentation in `docs/`
3. Check the server-specific README in each submodule
4. Open an issue on the respective GitHub repository
